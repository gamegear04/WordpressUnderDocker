# WordpressUnderDocker

Here is the docker-compose.yml to install Wordpress under Docker.

Two containers are created in a common network.

It is recommended to create a working folder before starting. Where in there you run the docker-compose.yml. The important Wordpress folders are then linked here, such as wp_content.

After downloading the file, it is simply executed in the terminal with the command docker-compose up.
